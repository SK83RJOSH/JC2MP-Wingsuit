# JC2MP-Wingsuit
Wingsuit script for Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. Showcases client-sided, player velocities.

Double-tap Shift to activate.
Double-tap Ctrl to deactivate.

While flying, hold Shift to increase speed or hold Ctrl to decrease speed.

To enable realism mode, change self.realism to true. This mode prevents players from changing speed while gliding and causes them to lose altitude over time. Realism mode also requires players to already be skydiving before they activate the wingsuit.
